    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p class="tanitma">I am Abdülkadir Toklu!</p>

    <p class="aciklama">
        I've always been interested in software since I was little.
        I started to learn from different branches of software by going over this interest of mine.
        I made a mistake I shouldn't have made first and started with cybersecurity.
        I wasn't supposed to do it because I didn't have a foundation yet.
        Over time, when I became aware of the existence of different areas, I directed myself to different areas.
        This is my little knowledge in areas such as web design, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, mobile application development, etc.
        made me own it.
        Currently, I know Html, Css, JavaScript, Intermediate level Python and basic level C#, I also know the Termux emulator and
        I can use the Linux operating system.
        I even :) using my computer as a dual boot.
        1. Kali Linux on my disk, 2. I :) have Windows 11 on my disk.
