## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you find any vulnerabilities in the "Form.php" or "Form.cs" files used for JavaScript, database or Backend, please let me know.
Remember that if you exploit any security vulnerability for your own benefit, you will only be responsible for it.
You can send it to me by using the "Contact Us.html" file included in the files to notify me of the security vulnerabilities you have detected, or at the "abdulkadir74280@mail.com" address.

The process of identifying and closing gaps;

## 1- Notification of Deficits to Us;

When you detect a vulnerability, please take a screenshot and scan it in Virustotal and share its hash with me.
The reason for doing this is to be able to switch to the backdoor attacks using the pests called trojans.

## 2- Investigation of Vulnerabilities;

After the accuracy of the vulnerabilities you have shared is examined, if there is such a vulnerability, you will be contacted via e-mail and thanked.
If it's a really big vulnerability, you'll be given special badges that other users can see on the forums.

## 3- Closing Gaps;

After the vulnerabilities are examined, the necessary arrangements are made, the gaps are closed and the files are updated.
